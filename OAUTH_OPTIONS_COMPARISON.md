# OAuth Options for Google Calendar Integration

## Current Setup (Recommended)

### Desktop Application OAuth via MCP Server

**Architecture:**
```
Web Browser → ADK Web → Python Agent → MCP Server → Google Calendar
                                          ↑
                                    Desktop OAuth
```

**OAuth Credentials Type:** Desktop Application

**How it works:**
1. MCP server runs locally/server-side
2. First time: Opens browser for OAuth consent
3. Tokens stored locally by MCP server
4. Web app users don't see OAuth flow
5. All calendar operations go through MCP server

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple setup and maintenance
- ✅ Secure token storage
- ✅ Users don't need individual OAuth
- ✅ Works with existing MCP infrastructure
- ✅ No CORS issues
- ✅ Server-side token refresh

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Single OAuth for all users (shared calendar access)
- ⚠️ Admin needs to do initial OAuth setup

## Alternative Option

### Web Application OAuth (Custom Implementation)

**Architecture:**
```
Web Browser → OAuth Flow → ADK Web → Python Agent → Google Calendar API
     ↑                                                        ↑
Web App OAuth                                        Direct API calls
```

**OAuth Credentials Type:** Web Application

**How it works:**
1. Each user does OAuth in browser
2. Web app handles OAuth flow
3. Tokens stored per user
4. Direct Google Calendar API calls

**Pros:**
- ✅ Per-user authentication
- ✅ User controls their own calendar access
- ✅ True multi-user support

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex implementation
- ❌ Need to handle CORS
- ❌ Custom token management
- ❌ No MCP server benefits
- ❌ More security considerations
- ❌ Would need to rewrite agent completely

## Recommendation

**Stick with Desktop OAuth via MCP Server** because:

1. **You're not losing functionality** - The web app still works perfectly
2. **Simpler architecture** - MCP handles all the complexity
3. **Better security** - Server-side token management
4. **Faster development** - No need to rewrite everything
5. **Production ready** - MCP servers are designed for this

## Multi-User Considerations

If you need **true multi-user calendar access** (each user accesses their own calendar):

### Option A: Multiple MCP Instances
- Run separate MCP server instance per user
- Each with their own OAuth tokens
- More complex but doable

### Option B: Service Account + Domain Delegation
- Use service accounts with domain-wide delegation
- Access any user's calendar via admin consent
- Good for enterprise/domain scenarios

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Keep MCP for admin/system calendars
- Add web OAuth for user-specific calendars
- More complex but most flexible

## For Your Use Case

You should have OAuth credentials configured in your `.env` file like:
```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

**Question:** Are these Desktop or Web application credentials?

You can check by looking at your Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
2. Find your OAuth client
3. Check the "Application type"

If they're Web application credentials, you have options:
1. Use them as-is (might work with MCP server)
2. Create new Desktop credentials for MCP server
3. Implement custom web OAuth flow

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Check your existing credential type** in Google Cloud Console
2. **If Web type:** Try using them with MCP server first
3. **If issues:** Create Desktop credentials as recommended
4. **Test the setup** with the provided test scripts
